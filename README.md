Global Announce
---------------
Global Announce lets you send and receive more than just normal chat messages, greatly expanding upon where messages can appear. You can have messages appear as a raid warning, in the UI Errors Frame (right above where raid warnings appear), as a pop-up, and in the scrolling combat text.  The addon will attempt to check permissions before allowing a player to send announcements to guild (allowed to send if the user can edit the GMOTD) or raid (allowed to send if the user is a raid assistant) channels.

Global Announce can only communicate with other players who also have the addon installed and enabled.  With this in mind, it is best suited for a guild environment.

Commands
--------
(v0.5) Type /ga in-game for a list of commands. A more in-depth explanation of all commands will be added here in the future.

Integration
-----------
Other addons can integrate with Global Announce.  For example, an addon can act as a server which sends the messages (for limitless possible purposes) from a single character.  All other players can use Global Announce as the client to receive these messages without the burden of extra CPU time being used since Global Announce is a very lightweight addon.  Global Announce Broadcaster provides the ability to define combat log events that should be announced to various channels.
