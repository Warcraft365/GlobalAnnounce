Other notes:
    * Prefix a sound path or ID with the at symbol (@) to prevent it from showing a message in the chat window, even if the user has verbose mode enabled.  Use with care.  This breaks backwards compatibility prior to version 0.8.1.  Users may override this option, but not by default.
    * Prefix a sound path or ID with the pound symbol (#) to have the sound played even while game sound is muted.  This breaks backwards compatibility prior to version 0.8.1.  Users may override this option, but not by default.  If also using the @ symbol, ensure that this one is placed after it.
    * It is highly recommended to use paths for sounds, as ID's can change between patches.
